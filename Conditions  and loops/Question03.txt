
Loops are programming constructs that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code multiple times. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures like arrays or lists.

There are several types of loops commonly used in programming languages, including:

1.  for> loop: A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you need to execute a block of code.

example -->

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}


2. while loop: A while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

example -->

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3. do...while loop: Similar to a while loop, but it always executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is false.

example -->

let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
  
4. for...in loop: Iterates over the properties of an object.

example -->

const person = {name: 'somil', age: 20};
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
}

5. for...of loop: Iterates over the values of an iterable object (arrays, strings, etc.).

example -->

const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
