
In JavaScript, conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. There are several types of conditional statements in JavaScript, including if, else if, and else. Here's a breakdown of each:

if statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.


if (condition) {
     code block to execute if condition is true
}

if...else statement: It executes one block of code if a specified condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

if (condition) {
     code block to execute if condition is true
} else {
     code block to execute if condition is false
}
if...else if...else statement: It allows you to specify multiple conditions to execute different blocks of code.



if (condition1) {
     code block to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    code block to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
     code block to execute if none of the conditions are true
}

Here's an example demonstrating the use of conditional statements in JavaScript:


let x = 10;

if (x > 0) {
    console.log("x is positive");
} else if (x < 0) {
    console.log("x is negative");
} else {
    console.log("x is zero");
}
In this example, if the value of x is greater than 0, it logs "x is positive" to the console. If it's less than 0, it logs "x is negative". If neither condition is true (i.e., x is equal to 0), it logs "x is zero".
